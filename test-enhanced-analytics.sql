-- Test the ENHANCED bulletproof view with visual fuel indicators
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to verify:
-- 1. Rolling averages show negative values (e.g., -4378) for consumption visualization
-- 2. Previous day used shows negative for consumption (-2500), positive for refills (+15000)
-- 3. Ullage shows available fuel capacity that can be added
-- 4. Jandakot now shows rolling average instead of 0
