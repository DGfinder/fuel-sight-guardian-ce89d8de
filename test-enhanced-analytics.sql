-- Test the ENHANCED bulletproof view (WITH REFILL PROTECTION)
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to verify:
-- 1. Rolling averages use consecutive readings only (eliminates over-counting)
-- 2. Refill protection: averages restart after refills for accurate rates
-- 3. Mt Claremont shows ~3000 L/day (NOT 16,829 L/day from over-counting)
-- 4. Tanks with recent refills show post-refill consumption patterns only
-- 5. Visual indicators work: minus signs for consumption, plus for refills
