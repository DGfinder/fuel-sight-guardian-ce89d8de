# TankAlert - Real-Time Fuel Tank Monitoring Dashboard

## What This Application Does

**TankAlert** is a real-time fuel tank monitoring dashboard that tracks fuel levels across multiple depots and prevents fuel shortages. It's specifically designed for fuel depot operators, truck depots, and fuel supply companies.

### Core Purpose:
- **Monitor fuel tank levels** in real-time across multiple locations
- **Prevent fuel shortages** with predictive alerts and consumption tracking
- **Track fuel usage patterns** with historical dip readings and consumption analytics
- **Manage multiple depots** with role-based access for different operators
- **Alert operators** when tanks reach critical or low fuel levels

### Who Uses This:
- **Fuel depot operators** monitoring tank levels and recording fuel readings
- **Depot managers** overseeing multiple tank groups and fuel operations  
- **Fleet managers** ensuring fuel availability for truck operations
- **Fuel supply companies** managing distributed fuel infrastructure

**Business Domain**: Australian fuel supply chain management, specifically for companies like Great Southern Fuels, Swan Transit, and other fuel depot operators.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The project has been organized into a clean, maintainable structure:

## Continuous Integration (CI)

This project includes automated CI checks that run on every push to the main branch and pull request. The CI pipeline ensures code quality and build stability.

### What the CI checks:

1. **Linting**: Runs ESLint to check for code style and potential issues
2. **Build**: Verifies the project can be successfully built for production

### CI Status

The CI pipeline will show linting warnings and errors but won't fail the build for warnings. This allows the project to continue functioning while still providing feedback on code quality issues.

### Viewing CI Results

- **GitHub Actions**: Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to see CI run history
- **Pull Requests**: CI status will be displayed on each PR
- **Main Branch**: CI runs automatically on every push to main
