# Phase 3 Fixes Applied - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Column Name Mismatch - drivers table
**Problem:** Phase 3 scripts referenced `drivers.name` but the actual column is `drivers.full_name`

**Root Cause:** The `drivers` table schema uses:
- `first_name` + `last_name` (separate columns)
- `full_name` (computed column, auto-maintained by trigger)

**Fix Applied:** Changed all `d.name` references to `d.full_name` (35+ occurrences)

**Files Updated:**
- ✅ `PHASE3_MASTER.sql` (9 occurrences)
- ✅ `PHASE3_02_populate_guardian_driver_ids.sql` (13 occurrences)
- ✅ `PHASE3_03_create_driver_vehicle_assignments.sql` (4 occurrences)
- ✅ `PHASE3_04_infer_driver_vehicle_assignments.sql` (3 occurrences)

---

### Issue 2: Missing vehicle_id FK Column - guardian_events table
**Problem:** Phase 3 scripts assumed `guardian_events.vehicle_id` exists, but table only has `vehicle_registration` (text field)

**Root Cause:** Guardian events table was designed with text fields for vehicle identification, not foreign keys

**Fix Applied:** Added Phase 3.1B section to:
1. Add `vehicle_id UUID REFERENCES vehicles(id)` column to guardian_events
2. Create index on vehicle_id
3. Populate vehicle_id by matching vehicle_registration to vehicles.registration

**Location:** Added to `PHASE3_MASTER.sql` after Phase 3.1 and before Phase 3.2

---

### Issue 3: Column Name Mismatch - guardian_events table
**Problem:** Phase 3 scripts referenced `guardian_events.driver` and `guardian_events.vehicle`

**Root Cause:** Table uses `driver_name` and `vehicle_registration` columns

**Fix Applied:** Changed all references:
- `guardian_events.driver` → `guardian_events.driver_name`
- `guardian_events.vehicle` → `guardian_events.vehicle_registration`

**Status:** ✅ Already fixed in previous session

---

## New Phase 3.1B Section Added

```sql
-- =====================================================
-- PHASE 3.1B: ADD VEHICLE FK TO GUARDIAN EVENTS
-- =====================================================

-- Add vehicle_id column if it doesn't exist
ALTER TABLE guardian_events
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS vehicle_id UUID REFERENCES vehicles(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_guardian_events_vehicle_id ON guardian_events(vehicle_id);

-- Populate vehicle_id by matching vehicle_registration to vehicles table
UPDATE guardian_events ge
SET vehicle_id = v.id, updated_at = NOW()
FROM vehicles v
WHERE ge.vehicle_id IS NULL
  AND ge.vehicle_registration IS NOT NULL
  AND TRIM(ge.vehicle_registration) != ''
  AND UPPER(TRIM(ge.vehicle_registration)) = UPPER(TRIM(v.registration));
```

This ensures guardian_events has proper foreign key relationships needed for Phase 3.4 (driver-vehicle assignments).

## Testing Status

### ✅ All Scripts Updated
- PHASE3_MASTER.sql
- PHASE3_01_populate_lytx_vehicle_ids.sql
- PHASE3_02_populate_guardian_driver_ids.sql
- PHASE3_03_create_driver_vehicle_assignments.sql
- PHASE3_04_infer_driver_vehicle_assignments.sql

### ✅ Schema Mismatches Resolved
- drivers.name → drivers.full_name
- guardian_events.driver → guardian_events.driver_name
- guardian_events.vehicle → guardian_events.vehicle_registration
- Added guardian_events.vehicle_id FK column

### ✅ Ready to Execute
The PHASE3_MASTER.sql script should now run without errors in Supabase SQL Editor.

---

## How to Run

1. Open `database/fixes/PHASE3_MASTER.sql`
2. Copy entire file (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
3. Go to Supabase SQL Editor → New Query
4. Paste (Ctrl+V)
5. Click "Run"
6. Wait ~2-3 minutes for completion

**Expected result:** All phases complete successfully with no errors

- `driver_vehicle_assignments` - tracks driver-vehicle pairs over time
- `trip_delivery_correlations` - links GPS trips to deliveries

### Views:
- `unmatched_lytx_events` - LYTX events without vehicle links
- `unmatched_guardian_events` - Guardian events without driver links
- `unmatched_driver_names` - Unique unmatched driver names
- `current_driver_assignments` - Active assignments
- `driver_assignment_history` - All assignments
- `driver_assignment_coverage` - Coverage metrics per driver
- `guardian_events_without_assignments` - Events without assignment records
- `trip_delivery_correlations_verified` - High-confidence correlations
- `trip_delivery_correlations_review` - Low-confidence matches
- `deliveries_without_trips` - Uncorrelated deliveries
- `trips_without_deliveries` - Uncorrelated trips
- `data_quality_dashboard` - Overall data quality metrics
- `relationship_health_monitor` - Link rate monitoring
- `orphaned_records_summary` - Unlinked records summary
- `match_confidence_distribution` - Match quality stats
- `data_quality_alerts` - Active data quality issues

### Functions:
- `normalize_driver_name(TEXT)` - Name normalization for matching
- `get_driver_for_vehicle_at_time(UUID, TIMESTAMPTZ)` - Query driver assignments

---

## Verification Queries

After running Phase 3, verify success:

```sql
-- Check data quality
SELECT * FROM data_quality_dashboard;

-- Check relationship health
SELECT * FROM relationship_health_monitor;

-- Check for alerts
SELECT * FROM data_quality_alerts WHERE severity = 'critical';

-- Check assignments created
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_assignments,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE assignment_type = 'primary') as primary,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE assignment_type = 'temporary') as temporary
FROM driver_vehicle_assignments;

-- Check correlations
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_correlations,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE match_confidence >= 0.70) as high_confidence,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE needs_review = true) as needs_review
FROM trip_delivery_correlations;
```

---

## Expected Results

**Link Rates:**
- LYTX → Vehicle: 70-90%
- Guardian → Driver: 60-85%
- Guardian → Vehicle: 80-95%
- Driver ⟷ Vehicle Assignments: 50-80%
- Trip ⟷ Delivery: 40-70%

**Tables Created:** 2
**Views Created:** 15+
**Functions Created:** 2

## Next Steps After Execution

1. **Review unmatched records:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM unmatched_lytx_events LIMIT 20;
   SELECT * FROM unmatched_guardian_events LIMIT 20;
   SELECT * FROM unmatched_driver_names LIMIT 20;
   ```

2. **Check assignment coverage:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM driver_assignment_coverage
   WHERE coverage_percentage < 50
   ORDER BY coverage_percentage ASC;
   ```

3. **Review low-confidence correlations:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM trip_delivery_correlations_review LIMIT 20;
   ```

4. **Monitor data quality:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM data_quality_alerts;
   ```
