# 🚀 Fresh Start Migration Guide

## Why Start Fresh?

Your current Supabase project has **infinite RLS recursion** issues that are extremely difficult to untangle. Starting fresh with a clean architecture will give you:

- ✅ **Stable, working application** immediately
- ✅ **No more 500 errors** from RLS recursion
- ✅ **Better performance** with simplified views
- ✅ **Clean, maintainable codebase** 
- ✅ **All your existing data** migrated safely

## 📋 Complete Migration Steps

### **Phase 1: Export Your Current Data**

#### **Step 1: Export Data from Current Project**

Run these queries in your **current Supabase SQL Editor** and save each result as CSV:

```sql
-- 1. Export Tank Groups
SELECT id, name, description, created_at, updated_at FROM tank_groups;

-- 2. Export Fuel Tanks  
SELECT id, location, product_type, safe_level, min_level, group_id, subgroup, 
       address, vehicle, discharge, bp_portal, delivery_window, afterhours_contact, 
       notes, serviced_on, serviced_by, latitude, longitude, created_at, updated_at 
FROM fuel_tanks;

-- 3. Export User Data
SELECT u.id, u.email, u.created_at, p.full_name, p.avatar_url 
FROM auth.users u 
LEFT JOIN profiles p ON u.id = p.id;

-- 4. Export User Roles
SELECT id, user_id, role, created_at, updated_at FROM user_roles;

-- 5. Export Group Permissions
SELECT id, user_id, group_id, created_at FROM user_group_permissions;

-- 6. Export Subgroup Permissions (if exists)
SELECT id, user_id, group_id, subgroup_name, created_at FROM user_subgroup_permissions;

-- 7. Export Recent Dip Readings (last 90 days to avoid huge exports)
SELECT id, tank_id, value, recorded_by, created_by_name, notes, created_at, updated_at
FROM dip_readings 
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
AND archived_at IS NULL
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- 8. Export Recent Alerts (if any)
SELECT id, tank_id, alert_type, message, acknowledged_at, acknowledged_by, snoozed_until, created_at
FROM tank_alerts 
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

**Save each query result as CSV** using the export button in Supabase SQL Editor.

---

### **Phase 2: Create New Supabase Project**

#### **Step 2: Create Fresh Project**

1. **Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)**
2. **Click "New Project"**
3. **Choose same region** as your current project
4. **Give it a clear name** (e.g., "fuel-sight-guardian-clean")
5. **Save the project URL and API keys**

#### **Step 3: Set Up Clean Database Schema**

In your **new project's SQL Editor**, run these scripts **in order**:

**3a. Create Tables:**
```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire contents of:
-- database/fresh-start/01_create_tables.sql
```

**3b. Create Non-Recursive RLS:**
```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire contents of:
-- database/fresh-start/02_create_non_recursive_rls.sql
```

**3c. Create Simplified Views:**
```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire contents of:
-- database/fresh-start/03_create_simplified_views.sql
```

After each script, you should see success messages confirming everything was created.

### **Phase 3: Migrate Your Data**

#### **Step 4: Create Users in New Project**

**🚨 CRITICAL:** This step prevents the foreign key error you encountered:

1. **Go to Authentication → Users** in your new Supabase dashboard
2. **Click "Add User"** for each user from your export
3. **Use same email addresses** as your old project
4. **Set temporary passwords** (users can reset them)
5. **📝 WRITE DOWN the new User IDs** - these look like: `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890`

**⚠️ The error you got happens when you use sample IDs instead of these real IDs!**

#### **Step 5: Import Your Data**

1. **Open** `database/fresh-start/04_data_migration_template.sql`
2. **Replace all sample data** with your exported CSV data
3. **Update User IDs** to match the new ones from Step 4
4. **Run the migration script** in your new project's SQL Editor

**Pro tip:** Do this in small batches (one table at a time) to catch any errors early.

---

### **Phase 4: Update Your Frontend**

#### **Step 6: Update Frontend Configuration**

Update your frontend to use the new Supabase project:

**In your `.env` file:**
```env
# Replace with your NEW project credentials
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-new-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-new-anon-key
```

**Or in `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`:**
```typescript
const supabaseUrl = 'https://your-new-project.supabase.co'
const supabaseKey = 'your-new-anon-key'
```

#### **Step 7: Test Your Application**

1. **Deploy your frontend** with the new Supabase credentials
2. **Test login** with your recreated users
3. **Check browser console** - you should see:
   ```
   ✅ [RBAC DEBUG] User role fetched successfully: admin
   ✅ [TANKS DEBUG] Successfully fetched tanks: {count: X}
   ```
4. **No more 500 errors!**

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Migration Fails:**

**Foreign Key Errors:**
- Make sure you import data in the correct order (groups → tanks → readings)
- Check that all referenced IDs exist in parent tables

**User ID Mismatches:**
- Double-check that user IDs in your data match the new Auth user IDs
- Use the Auth dashboard to verify user IDs

**Permission Errors:**
- Verify that your user has the correct role in the `user_roles` table
- Check that group permissions are set up correctly

### **If Frontend Still Has Issues:**

**500 Errors Persist:**
- Clear browser cache completely (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
- Check that you're using the correct new Supabase URL

**No Tank Data:**
- Run the view test queries to verify data exists
- Check browser network tab for failed requests
- Verify RLS policies are working correctly

**Authentication Issues:**
- Make sure users exist in both Auth and `user_roles` table
- Check that role names match exactly ('admin', 'manager', etc.)

## 📊 **Validation Checklist**

After migration, verify these work:

- [ ] **Login works** without 500 errors
- [ ] **Tank data displays** with correct percentages
- [ ] **GSFS Narrogin tanks** show expected values (61%, 14%, 77%)
- [ ] **Rolling averages calculate** (in frontend, not database)
- [ ] **Dip readings work** (add new readings, view history)
- [ ] **User permissions work** (correct tanks visible per user)
- [ ] **Performance is good** (fast page loads, no timeouts)
