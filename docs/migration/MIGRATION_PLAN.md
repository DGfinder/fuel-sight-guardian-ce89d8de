## 1. Current State Analysis

### Current Architecture
```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Frontend      │    │   Supabase      │    │   PostgreSQL    │
│   React + Vite  │───▶│   Auth/API/RT   │───▶│   Database      │
│   TypeScript    │    │   Edge Functions│    │   + RLS         │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

### Current Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18.3.1, Vite, TypeScript, shadcn/ui, Tailwind
- **Backend**: Supabase (Auth, Database, Real-time, Edge Functions)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS)
- **State Management**: TanStack Query + Zustand
- **Deployment**: Vercel (Frontend)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime

### Current Database Schema
```sql
-- Core Tables
tank_groups (id, name, created_at)
fuel_tanks (id, location, group_id, subgroup, safe_level, current_level, min_level)
dip_readings (id, tank_id, value, created_at, recorded_by, notes)
profiles (id, full_name, email, created_at)

-- RBAC Tables
user_roles (user_id, role, created_at)
user_group_permissions (user_id, group_id, created_at)

-- Views/Materialized Views
tanks_with_rolling_avg (computed tank metrics)
```

### Current Pain Points
1. **Vendor Lock-in**: Heavily dependent on Supabase ecosystem
2. **Limited Backend Logic**: Complex business rules handled in frontend
3. **Scaling Limitations**: Performance bottlenecks with large datasets
4. **Real-time Complexity**: Difficult to customize real-time behavior
5. **Testing Challenges**: Limited ability to test backend logic
6. **Cost Scaling**: Expensive as data volume grows
