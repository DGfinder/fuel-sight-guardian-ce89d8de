name: 'CI - Lint & Build'

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  # Triggers the workflow on pull request events targeting the "main" branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "lint-and-build"
  lint-and-build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Sets up a specific version of Node.js for the job to use
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20' # Using a modern, stable version of Node.js
          cache: 'npm' # Enables caching of npm dependencies

      # Step 3: Installs project dependencies using 'npm ci' for a clean, reliable install
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Runs the ESLint command to check code quality
      # This step will show linting issues but won't fail the build
      - name: Run linter
        run: npm run lint
        continue-on-error: true

      # Step 5: Runs the build command to make sure the project can be compiled for production
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build
