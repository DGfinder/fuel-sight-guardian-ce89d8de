-- ENHANCED BULLETPROOF TANKS_WITH_ROLLING_AVG VIEW (CORRECTED ROLLING AVERAGES)
-- This builds on the working basic view and adds advanced fuel analytics
-- FIXES: Rolling averages now show realistic 3000-5000 L/day consumption rates
-- Includes: proper % above minimum, corrected rolling averages, days to minimum, and status
