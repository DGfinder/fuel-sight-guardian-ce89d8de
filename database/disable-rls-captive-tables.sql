-- DISABLE RLS ON BASE TABLE - SHOW ALL DATA

-- This removes Row Level Security restrictions that are causing
-- data access issues in the dashboard
-- 
-- APPROACH: Page-level access control (authorized users only)
-- Once authorized â†’ show ALL 23,756 deliveries (no per-record filtering)
-- 
-- NOTE: Materialized views can't have RLS disabled (PostgreSQL limitation)
-- We only need to disable RLS on the base table

-- Disable RLS on base records table (feeds the materialized view)
ALTER TABLE captive_payment_records DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Note: captive_deliveries is a materialized view - can't disable RLS on it
-- This is fine - materialized views don't have RLS, they inherit from base tables

-- Verify RLS is disabled on base table
