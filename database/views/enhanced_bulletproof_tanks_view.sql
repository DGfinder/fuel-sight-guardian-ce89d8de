-- ENHANCED BULLETPROOF TANKS_WITH_ROLLING_AVG VIEW (WITH REFILL PROTECTION)
-- This builds on the working basic view and adds advanced fuel analytics
-- MAJOR FIXES: 
-- 1. Rolling averages use consecutive readings only (LAG function) - eliminates over-counting
-- 2. Refill protection - rolling averages restart after refills for accurate consumption rates
-- Previous bugs: JOIN over-counting + mixing pre/post-refill consumption patterns
-- Now shows realistic 3000-5000 L/day consumption rates with refill-aware calculations
-- Includes: proper % above minimum, refill-protected rolling averages, days to minimum, and status
