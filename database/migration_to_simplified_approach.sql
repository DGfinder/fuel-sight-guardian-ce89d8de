-- COMPLETE MIGRATION TO SIMPLIFIED STABLE APPROACH
-- This script migrates from the unstable tanks_with_rolling_avg view to a stable architecture
-- 
-- BEFORE: Complex database view with CTEs, window functions, and RLS recursion issues
-- AFTER: Simple database view + frontend analytics = Stable and maintainable
--
-- Expected Results:
-- ✅ No more 500 errors from RLS infinite recursion
-- ✅ Fast, stable database queries
-- ✅ Better performance and debugging
-- ✅ Flexible analytics in frontend
