# Wayne Bowron - 1IDB419 Association Implementation

This document describes the implementation of driver-vehicle association mapping between **Wayne Bowron** and vehicle **1IDB419** across all data sources.

## Overview

The implementation creates comprehensive associations between Wayne Bowron and vehicle 1IDB419 for:
- **MTData trip history** records
- **Guardian safety events**  
- **LYTX safety events**
- **Vehicle assignment** records

## Files Created

### 1. Database Migration
- **File:** `database/migrations/associate_wayne_bowron_1idb419.sql`
- **Purpose:** Creates all driver-vehicle associations
- **Features:**
  - Verifies/creates Wayne Bowron driver record
  - Adds name variations to `driver_name_mappings`
  - Creates vehicle assignment in `driver_assignments`
  - Associates MTData trips, Guardian events, and LYTX events
  - Includes verification queries

### 2. Reusable Database Functions
- **File:** `database/functions/associate_driver_with_vehicle.sql`
- **Functions:**
  - `associate_driver_with_vehicle()` - Create driver-vehicle associations
  - `get_driver_vehicle_associations()` - Retrieve association summary
- **Usage:**
  ```sql
  -- Create associations
  SELECT associate_driver_with_vehicle('Wayne', 'Bowron', '1IDB419');
  
  -- Get summary
  SELECT get_driver_vehicle_associations('Wayne', 'Bowron', '1IDB419');
  ```

### 3. Verification Script
- **File:** `tools/verify-wayne-bowron-associations.js`
- **Purpose:** Validates all associations are working correctly
- **Features:**
  - Checks driver and vehicle records
  - Verifies MTData, Guardian, and LYTX associations
  - Tests database functions
  - Provides comprehensive reporting

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
```bash
# Execute the migration in your Supabase SQL editor or psql client
psql -f database/migrations/associate_wayne_bowron_1idb419.sql
```

### Step 2: Create Database Functions
```bash
# Create the reusable functions
psql -f database/functions/associate_driver_with_vehicle.sql
```

### Step 3: Verify Implementation
```bash
# Run the verification script
node tools/verify-wayne-bowron-associations.js
```

## Expected Results

After running the migration, you should see:

1. **Driver Record:** Wayne Bowron created/verified in `drivers` table
2. **Name Mappings:** Multiple name variations added to `driver_name_mappings`
3. **Vehicle Assignment:** Active assignment between Wayne Bowron and 1IDB419
4. **Data Associations:**
   - All MTData trips for 1IDB419 linked to Wayne Bowron
   - All Guardian events for 1IDB419 linked to Wayne Bowron
   - All LYTX events for Wayne Bowron properly associated

## Verification Queries

### Check Driver Record
```sql
SELECT * FROM drivers 
WHERE first_name = 'Wayne' AND last_name = 'Bowron';
```

### Check MTData Associations
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as trip_count
FROM mtdata_trip_history mth
JOIN drivers d ON mth.driver_id = d.id
WHERE mth.vehicle_registration = '1IDB419'
AND d.first_name = 'Wayne' AND d.last_name = 'Bowron';
```

### Check Guardian Associations
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as event_count
FROM guardian_events ge
JOIN drivers d ON ge.driver_id = d.id
WHERE ge.vehicle_registration = '1IDB419'
AND d.first_name = 'Wayne' AND d.last_name = 'Bowron';
```

### Check Vehicle Assignment
```sql
SELECT da.*, v.registration, d.first_name, d.last_name
FROM driver_assignments da
JOIN vehicles v ON da.vehicle_id = v.id
JOIN drivers d ON da.driver_id = d.id
WHERE v.registration = '1IDB419'
AND da.unassigned_at IS NULL;
```

## Data Quality Features

- **Confidence Scoring:** All associations include confidence scores (1.0 for known relationships)
- **Association Methods:** Tracks how associations were created (`manual_assignment_known_vehicle`)
- **Audit Trail:** Timestamps for when associations were created/updated
- **Name Variations:** Supports multiple name formats across different systems

## Future Usage

The reusable functions created can be used for other driver-vehicle associations:

```sql
-- Associate another driver with their vehicle
SELECT associate_driver_with_vehicle('John', 'Smith', '1ABC123');

-- Get comprehensive summary for any driver-vehicle pair
SELECT get_driver_vehicle_associations('John', 'Smith', '1ABC123');
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Migration Fails
1. Check database connectivity
2. Ensure required tables exist (`drivers`, `mtdata_trip_history`, `guardian_events`, etc.)
3. Verify user permissions for table modifications

### If Verification Script Fails
1. Check environment variables (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`)
2. Ensure Node.js dependencies are installed (`@supabase/supabase-js`)
3. Verify database connection and table access permissions

## Performance Considerations

- **Batch Updates:** Migration uses efficient batch updates
- **Index Usage:** Leverages existing indexes on vehicle_registration and driver_id
- **Minimal Lock Time:** Uses single transaction to minimize table lock duration

## Compliance & Security

- **RLS Compliance:** Respects existing Row Level Security policies
- **Audit Trail:** All changes are timestamped and trackable
- **Permission Checks:** Uses existing authentication and authorization
