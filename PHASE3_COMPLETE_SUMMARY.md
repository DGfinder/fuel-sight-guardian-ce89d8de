- **LYTX events linked to vehicles** (70-90% match rate)
- **Guardian events linked to drivers** (60-85% match rate)
- **Driver-vehicle assignments tracked** over time periods
- **GPS trips correlated to deliveries** with confidence scores
- **Data quality dashboards** for monitoring health
- **10+ review views** for unmatched records

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

After running Phase 3:

### 1. Check Overall Data Quality
```sql
SELECT * FROM data_quality_dashboard;
```

**Expected:**
- All data sources listed
- Link percentages > 60%
- Quality scores > 60

---

### 2. Check Relationship Health
```sql
SELECT * FROM relationship_health_monitor;
```

**Expected:**
- LYTX ‚Üí Vehicle: 70-90%
- Guardian ‚Üí Driver: 60-85%
- Guardian ‚Üí Vehicle: 80-95%
- Assignments: 50-80%
- Trip ‚ü∑ Delivery: 40-70%

---

### 3. Check for Critical Alerts
```sql
SELECT * FROM data_quality_alerts
WHERE severity = 'critical';
```

**Expected:** 0 critical alerts (warnings OK)

---

### 4. Check Assignments Created
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_assignments,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE assignment_type = 'primary') as primary,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE assignment_type = 'temporary') as temporary
FROM driver_vehicle_assignments;
```

**Expected:** At least 10-20 assignments

---

### 5. Check Trip-Delivery Correlations
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE match_confidence >= 0.70) as high_confidence,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE needs_review = true) as needs_review
FROM trip_delivery_correlations;
```

**Expected:** Correlations created, mix of confidence levels

---

## üîç What to Do Next

### 1. Review Unmatched Records

**LYTX Events:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM unmatched_lytx_events LIMIT 20;
```
- Look for patterns (missing vehicles, typos in registrations)
- Add missing vehicles to `vehicles` table
- Re-run PHASE3_01 if needed

**Guardian Events:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM unmatched_guardian_events LIMIT 20;
```
- Look for patterns (missing drivers, name variations)
- Add missing drivers to `drivers` table
- Re-run PHASE3_02 if needed

---

### 2. Check Assignment Coverage

```sql
SELECT * FROM driver_assignment_coverage
WHERE coverage_percentage < 50
ORDER BY coverage_percentage ASC;
```

**Low coverage means:**
- Driver's events aren't covered by assignments
- May need manual assignment creation
- Or driver is a floater (no consistent vehicle)

---

### 3. Review Low-Confidence Correlations

```sql
SELECT * FROM trip_delivery_correlations_review
LIMIT 20;
```

**Manually verify:**
- Is this trip actually related to this delivery?
- Mark as verified if correct:
  ```sql
  UPDATE trip_delivery_correlations
  SET is_verified = true, needs_review = false
  WHERE id = 'correlation-uuid';
  ```

---

### 4. Monitor Data Quality

Set up regular checks:

```sql
-- Run daily/weekly
SELECT * FROM data_quality_dashboard;
SELECT * FROM data_quality_alerts;
SELECT * FROM orphaned_records_summary;
```

**Watch for:**
- Declining link percentages (data quality issue)
- Increasing orphaned records (missing master data)
- New critical alerts (integration issues)

---

## üìà Expected Results

### Link Rates

| Relationship | Target | Excellent | Good | Needs Work |
|--------------|--------|-----------|------|------------|
| LYTX ‚Üí Vehicle | 80% | >90% | 70-90% | <70% |
| Guardian ‚Üí Driver | 75% | >85% | 60-85% | <60% |
| Guardian ‚Üí Vehicle | 90% | >95% | 80-95% | <80% |
| Driver ‚ü∑ Vehicle | 65% | >80% | 50-80% | <50% |
| Trip ‚ü∑ Delivery | 55% | >70% | 40-70% | <40% |

### Match Quality

| Confidence Level | Percentage | Action |
|------------------|------------|--------|
| Excellent (‚â•90%) | 30-50% | None - verified |
| Good (70-89%) | 30-40% | Optional review |
| Fair (50-69%) | 10-20% | Review recommended |
| Poor (<50%) | <10% | Manual review required |

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Low LYTX Match Rate

**Problem:** <50% of LYTX events linked to vehicles

**Solutions:**
1. Check registration format consistency
2. Add missing vehicles to `vehicles` table
3. Review `unmatched_lytx_events` for patterns
4. Lower fuzzy match threshold (edit script, change 0.85 to 0.75)

---

### Low Guardian Match Rate

**Problem:** <40% of Guardian events linked to drivers

**Solutions:**
1. Check name format consistency
2. Add missing drivers to `drivers` table
3. Review `unmatched_driver_names` for patterns
4. Create name aliases/mappings
5. Lower fuzzy match threshold (edit script, change 0.80 to 0.70)

---

### Few Assignments Created

**Problem:** <10 driver-vehicle assignments

**Solutions:**
1. Check if Guardian events have both driver_id and vehicle_id populated
2. Lower event count threshold (edit PHASE3_04, change 3 to 2)
3. Add manual assignments for known pairings
4. Wait for more event data to accumulate

---

### Low Trip-Delivery Correlation

**Problem:** <30% of trips/deliveries correlated

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Phase 3.1 completed (LYTX vehicle links)
2. Check if captive_deliveries has vehicle_id populated
3. Widen time window (edit PHASE3_05, change 30 to 60 minutes)
4. Review vehicle_id population in both mtdata_raw and captive_deliveries

---

### Script Timeout

**Problem:** Script runs >5 minutes or times out

**Solutions:**
1. Run individual scripts instead of PHASE3_MASTER
2. Verify indexes exist on tables
3. Filter by date range (edit scripts to add WHERE clauses)
4. Increase statement timeout in Supabase settings

---

Phase 3 is successful when:

- ‚úÖ PHASE3_MASTER.sql runs without errors
- ‚úÖ All 15+ views created and queryable
- ‚úÖ data_quality_dashboard shows results
